/*
 * 2. Simple Banking System

Problem Statement: 
Create a simple banking system that allows a user to deposit and withdraw money. 
The program should:
Start with an initial balance of $1000.
Prompt the user to enter the amount to deposit or withdraw.
Ensure that the withdrawal does not exceed the current balance.
Display the updated balance after each transaction.

Requirements:
Use variables to store the balance and transaction amounts.
Implement type casting if necessary (e.g., converting user input to double).
Use escape sequences to format the output.
