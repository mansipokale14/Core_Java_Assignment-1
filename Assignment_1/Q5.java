    	/*5. Basic Quiz Application

Problem Statement: 
Develop a simple quiz application that asks the user three multiple-choice questions. 
For each question, the user should input their answer, and the program should keep track of the score. 
At the end of the quiz, display the total score and percentage.

Requirements:
Use variables to store questions, options, user answers, and scores.
Implement type casting if necessary (e.g., converting user input to an integer for score calculation).
Use escape sequences to format the questions and options clearly.
Calculate the percentage based on the total score.*/
